        ''' ```
        ''' And so the MA coefficients differ in sign from those of S-PLUS. Further, if include.mean Is true (the default for an ARMA model), this formula applies to X - m rather than X. 
        ''' For ARIMA models with differencing, the differenced series follows a zero-mean ARMA model. If am xreg term Is included, a linear regression (with a constant term if include.mean 
        ''' Is true And there Is no differencing) Is fitted with an ARMA model for the error term.
        ''' The variance matrix Of the estimates Is found from the Hessian Of the log-likelihood, And so may only be a rough guide.
        ''' Optimization Is done by optim. It will work best if the columns in xreg are roughly scaled to zero mean And unit variance, but does attempt to estimate suitable scalings.

        ''' The function ts is used to create time-series objects. These are vector or matrices with class of "ts" (and additional attributes) which represent data which has been sampled at equispaced points in time. In the matrix case, each column of the matrix data is assumed to contain a single (univariate) time series. Time series must have at least one observation, and although they need not be numeric there is very limited support for non-numeric series.
        ''' Class "ts" has a number of methods. In particular arithmetic will attempt to align time axes, And subsetting to extract subsets of series can be used (e.g., EuStockMarkets[, "DAX"]). However, subsetting the first (Or only) dimension will return a matrix Or vector, as will matrix subsetting. Subassignment can be used to replace values but Not to extend a series (see window). There Is a method for t that transposes the series as a matrix (a one-column matrix if a vector) And hence returns a result that does Not inherit from class "ts".
        ''' The value Of argument frequency Is used When the series Is sampled an integral number Of times In Each unit time interval. For example, one could use a value Of 7 For frequency When the data are sampled daily, And the natural time period Is a week, Or 12 When the data are sampled monthly And the natural time period Is a year. Values Of 4 And 12 are assumed In (e.g.) print methods To imply a quarterly And monthly series respectively.
